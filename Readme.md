# UrbanCanyonGNSS

This repository contains some of the features I created while working on my diploma thesis. Over time I want to make them all available here.

To install all the dependencies, run the `install.jl` script

You should then be able to run the scripts contained in the "src/analysis/" and "src/scripts/" from Julia using `(include(PATH_TO_SCRIPT))`.
